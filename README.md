# Generating and Classifying Lyrics with LSTM Networks

## Background:
For my Undergraduate Thesis, I worked with Professor Heni Ben Amor and Professor Jorge Caviedes at Arizona State University to research about LSTM networks and their effectiveness in classifying and generating lyrics. This repository represents the work that has went into making this project possible. The majority of the work was done on Google Colab. The notebooks used are provided in this repo and require the use of a GPU.
