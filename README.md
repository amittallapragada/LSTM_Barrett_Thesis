# Generating and Classifying Lyrics with LSTM Networks

## Background:
For my Honors Thesis, I worked with Professor Heni Ben Amor and Professor Jorge Caviedes at Arizona State University to research about LSTMs and their effectiveness in classifying and generating lyrics. This repository represents the work that has went into making this project a reality. The majority of this work was done on Google Colab. The notebooks used on it are provided in this repo and require the use of a GPU.
